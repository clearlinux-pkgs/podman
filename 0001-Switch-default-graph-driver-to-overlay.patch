Subject: [PATCH] Switch default graph driver to overlay

podman will be primarily used rootless and given they recommend using
overlay as the default graphdriver for rootless, we might as well set
that as the default.

This also fixes the error.
ERRO[0000] User-selected graph driver "overlay" overwritten by graph driver "vfs" from database - delete libpod local files to resolve
